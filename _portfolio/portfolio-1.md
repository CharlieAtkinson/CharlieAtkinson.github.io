I developed a digit classification program in Python that uses the MNIST dataset.
Used TensorFlow and NumPy to build and train a machine learning model capable of predicting the digit in new images
it hasn't seen before. This project introduced me to the fundamentals of computer vision, including image
preprocessing techniques such as normalisation and reshaping.
Despite initial challenges as it was my first experience with machine learning, I successfully trained an accurate model.
