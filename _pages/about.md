Innovating in Robotics and AI 🤖  
I’m a final-year undergraduate student at the University of Hull, focusing on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

## About Me

🌐 **Mission**  
I’m driven by the goal of designing and developing intelligent solutions that tackle real-world challenges. My skill set includes machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. I’m constantly expanding my knowledge through hands-on projects and self-learning.

🎓 **Academic Journey**  
As a Robotics and AI undergraduate, I’ve built a strong foundation in Python programming, AI algorithms, and hands-on implementations. I aim to pursue a master’s degree at a top-tier institution and contribute to cutting-edge AI research.
## Research Interests

🧬 **Exploring New Frontiers**  
Key interests include:
- Machine Learning Algorithms
- Deep Learning (CNNs, Transformers)
- Computer Vision
- Natural Language Processing

🧰 **Technical Skills**  
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch  
- NLP pipelines, tokenisation, embeddings (GloVe, Word2Vec, BERT)  
- Data preprocessing, visualisation, and model evaluation  
- Multi-input deep learning models  
- Git, GitHub, Kaggle, Jupyter Notebooks  


🔧 **Current Projects**  
I’m actively building a portfolio that showcases AI-driven solutions, including NLP classification models, computer vision applications, and robotics projects. I also compete in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) challenges to sharpen my practical ML skills and my most recent submission scored **0.80140** on the *Disaster Tweet Classification* leaderboard.

## Professional Development

🌐 **Future Goals**  
I aspire to transition into advanced research roles and make a global impact in AI innovation.
